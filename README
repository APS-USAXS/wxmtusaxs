*wxmtusaxs* (an EPICS GUI tool) provides support for documenting
the positions of USAXS samples and generating a SPEC macro
script to scan those samples.  It was derived from the
*wxmtxy* project.  *wxmtxy* is based on wxPython and relies on 
CaChannel to communicate with EPICS.

For more help, explanations are provided in the HTML pages.
